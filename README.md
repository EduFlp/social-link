<---------------------------------BUILT WITH------------------------------->
- Semantic HTML 5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS grid

<----------------------------------WHAT I LEARNED------------------------->
I was able to recall CSS concepts that I had already seen, such as hover. In addition, I was able to use new HTML tags, like the button tag and the form tag. 
There are other concepts that I have discovered. However, I have not done a deep search to find out their meanings and when to use them, like @media.

<-------------------------------CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT--------------------->
I rely heavily on YouTube examples to do my jobs, so I think my autonomy is still far from being complete. My knowledge of HTML has improved, but it still needs more development. Additionally, my knowledge of CSS continues to be weakned because of the lack research, which is something I need to do.
